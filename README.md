Genetic algorytm for Job Shop Schdeuling problem.
use:
compile -> g++ main.cpp
./a.out [file with the problem] [format - 0 for Beilrey, 1 for Tailor] [max work time, the more the better results (goes to 150s if not specified]
Output is standard output (to console), if you want to file must add 1> [output file name].
(((Under branch solve1 there is a non working GRASP algorythm for the same problem. Might be useful to some, but it is not optimal)))
